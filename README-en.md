# OpenSpec Practise

This project originated from in-depth discussions on AI programming within the "AI Force Injection" community. In response to the community's vision of "leveraging OpenSpec for Spec-Driven Development," this project demonstrates the practical application of the OpenSpec specification in AI-assisted programming through a complete hands-on example.

As a learning and practice repository for OpenSpec, this project provides systematic documentation analysis, detailed user manuals, and multi-language examples, aimed at helping developers deeply understand and efficiently apply the specification.

## Project Structure

This project consists of four core modules:

### 1. Documentation

Contains theoretical analysis and practical guides for OpenSpec, helping to understand the ideas and workflows behind the specification.

- **[OpenSpec User Manual](docs-en/openspec-user-manual.md)**: The complete user manual for OpenSpec, covering installation, initialization, documentation standards, validation, best practices, and more.

  > "OpenSpec is a **Spec-Driven Development (SDD) framework** designed specifically for AI programming assistants. It ensures that humans and AI reach a shared understanding of requirements by defining specifications before writing code." — _OpenSpec User Manual_

  Companion slides: [Legacy PPT](docs/openspec-user-manual-v1.pptx) · [Current PPT](docs/openspec-user-manual-v2.pptx)

- **[OpenSpec Practical Guide](docs-en/openspec-practical-guide.md)**: A concrete implementation guide for putting OpenSpec into practice.

  > "OpenSpec is not just a documentation format — it is an engineering practice of **Spec-Driven Development**. It advocates 'specification as the source of truth,' ensuring that code and tests always remain consistent with the design." — _OpenSpec Practical Guide_

- **[OpenSpec Practical Guide: A Deep Retrospective on AI-Assisted Software Engineering End-to-End](docs-en/openspec-ai-workflow-analysis.md)**: An in-depth analysis of the role and value of OpenSpec in AI programming workflows.
  > "The traditional development model is **Requirements -> Human -> Code**, while the new paradigm is evolving into **Intent -> Spec (OpenSpec) -> AI -> Code & Verification**." — _OpenSpec AI Workflow Analysis_

### 2. Example Code

A minimal multi-language implementation (MVP) based on an e-commerce scenario, demonstrating how the OpenSpec specification drives code delivery.

- **`ecommerce-mini` (Node.js)**
  - `src/domain`: Core business logic, a clean domain layer.
  - `src/http`: API interface implementation.
  - `src/services`: Business service layer.
  - `src/repo`: In-memory data storage.
  - `src/persist`: File-based persistent storage.
  - `__tests__`: Accompanying test cases (unit tests, integration tests, performance tests).

- **`ecommerce-mini-python` (Python)**
  - `src/domain`: Domain models defined with Pydantic.
  - `src/services`: Business service layer.
  - `src/api`: API service implemented with FastAPI.
  - `src/repo`: In-memory data storage.
  - `tests`: Pytest test suite.

### 3. OpenSpec Specifications

Complete specification files demonstrating the SDD workflow, stored under `examples/openspec/`.

- **`examples/openspec/config.yaml`**: Project context configuration (tech stack, conventions, etc.), automatically injected into each AI planning request.
- **`examples/openspec/changes/v1-mvp/`**: Complete change specifications for the MVP version (archived).
  - `proposal.md`: Change proposal (Why / What Changes / Capabilities).
  - `design.md`: System architecture design (layered architecture and data flow).
  - `tasks.md`: Implementation task checklist.
  - `specs/domain-model/spec.md`: Core domain model specification.
  - `specs/catalog-management/spec.md`: Product catalog management specification.
  - `specs/cart-management/spec.md`: Shopping cart management specification.
  - `specs/order-management/spec.md`: Order management specification.
  - `specs/payment/spec.md`: Payment specification.
  - `specs/error-handling/spec.md`: Error handling specification.
- **`examples/openspec/specs/`**: Archived master specifications (merged from v1-mvp).

### 4. Test Data

Test data files used by the example projects.

- **`examples/ecommerce-mini/data/`**: Test data for the Node.js version.
  - `products.json`: Product data.
  - `carts.json`: Cart data.
  - `orders.json`: Order data.

## Core Features

This project demonstrates the following core OpenSpec features:

- **Spec-Driven Development**: Define specifications first, then write code, ensuring AI and humans reach a shared understanding of requirements.
- **Multi-language Implementation**: Using the same specification to drive both Node.js and Python implementations.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.
- **Production-Grade Extensions**: Persistent storage, authentication, idempotency, and observability.
- **Deep AI Collaboration**: Generate OPSX slash commands (`/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:apply`, etc.) via `openspec init`, supporting standardized collaborative workflows with 20+ AI programming assistants.

## Quick Start

### Node.js Example

Navigate to the `examples/ecommerce-mini` directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies (no external dependencies in this project, but good practice)
npm install

# Run tests (using Node.js built-in test runner)
npm test

# Start development server (in-memory storage, listening on port 3000 by default)
npm start

# Start production server (file persistence, authentication, listening on port 3002 by default)
npm run start:prod
```

### Python Example

Navigate to the `examples/ecommerce-mini-python` directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest

# Start server (listening on port 8000 by default)
python -m uvicorn src.api.server:app --reload
```

## Learning Path

Recommended learning order:

1. **Getting Started**: Read the [OpenSpec User Manual](docs-en/openspec-user-manual.md) to understand the basic concepts and usage of OpenSpec.
2. **Practice**: Read the [OpenSpec Practical Guide](docs-en/openspec-practical-guide.md) to understand how to apply it in real projects.
3. **Deep Dive**: Read the [OpenSpec Practical Guide: A Deep Retrospective on AI-Assisted Software Engineering End-to-End](docs-en/openspec-ai-workflow-analysis.md) to learn best practices for AI collaboration.
4. **Hands-On**: Run `examples/ecommerce-mini` and `examples/ecommerce-mini-python` to experience spec-driven development firsthand.
5. **Research**: Browse the specification files under `examples/openspec/changes/v1-mvp/` to learn how to write specifications.

## Companion AI Skills

To more efficiently implement OpenSpec specifications in real-world development, this project recommends pairing with a dedicated AI assistant skill.

- **[OpenSpec Assistant](https://github.com/ForceInjection/awesome-skills/tree/main/openspec-assistant)**: An AI skill designed specifically for executing OpenSpec Spec-Driven Development (SDD). It covers the complete lifecycle of intent alignment, specification generation, code implementation, and automated verification. It also supports multi-role collaboration among architects (writing and reviewing specs), developers (writing code), and QA engineers (writing tests), and natively supports the `/opsx` command system used in this project.
